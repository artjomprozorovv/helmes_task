#### TODO

+ Test should be created for SetHandler
+ Would be good to use something more to test functionality and not just JUnit
+ Try catch blocks should be added where they need to be added
+ Custom Exception is always a great idea to be more specific
+ Some refactoring in general would be a good idea 
+ Recheck function names make sure they are sufficient
